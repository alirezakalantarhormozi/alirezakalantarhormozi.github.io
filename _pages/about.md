<p align="justify"> I recently graduated from </a href='https://www.essex.ac.uk/'>the University of Essex</a> with an MSc in Artificial Intelligence. In addition, I hold a BSc in Computer Engineering from </a href='https://pgu.ac.ir/en'> Persian Gulf University</a>. In my MSc dissertation, I worked on automating medical image captioning methods under the supervision of </a href='https://www.essex.ac.uk/people/CITIL35902/Luca-Citi'>Prof. Luca Citi.</a> I also collaborated closely with </a href='https://www.essex.ac.uk/people/KOLOZ89402/Sefki-Kolozali'>Dr. Sefki Kolozali</a> on a project to assist blind individuals through AI and audio technologies using smart glasses. During my BSc studies, I worked on search engines with various AI methods under the supervision of </a href='https://research.pgu.ac.ir//~HRostami/en/'>Dr. Habib Rostami.</a> I am currently seeking PhD positions, and my research interests include computer vision, deep generative AI, object detection, trajectory planning, and reasoning in computer vision. Additionally, I am interested in language models (LLMs), optimization techniques for them, and the theoretical foundations of learning.
