I recently graduated from [the University of Essex](https://www.essex.ac.uk/) with an MSc in Artificial Intelligence. In addition, I hold a BSc in Computer Engineering from [Persian Gulf University](https://pgu.ac.ir/en). In my MSc dissertation, I worked on automating medical image captioning methods under the supervision of [Prof. Luca Citi.](https://www.essex.ac.uk/people/CITIL35902/Luca-Citi) I also collaborated closely with [Dr. Sefki Kolozali](https://www.essex.ac.uk/people/KOLOZ89402/Sefki-Kolozali) on a project to assist blind individuals through AI and audio technologies using smart glasses. During my BSc studies, I worked on search engines with various AI methods under the supervision of [Dr. Habib Rostami.](https://research.pgu.ac.ir//~HRostami/en/) I am currently seeking PhD positions, and my research interests include computer vision, deep generative AI, object detection, trajectory planning, and reasoning in computer vision. Additionally, I am interested in language models (LLMs), optimization techniques for them, and the theoretical foundations of learning.
