I recently graduated from the University of Essex with an MSc in Artificial Intelligence. In addition, I hold a BSc in Computer Engineering from Persian Gulf University. In my MSc dissertation, I worked on automating medical image captioning methods under the supervision of Prof. Luca Citi.[subreddit](http://reddit.com) I also collaborated closely with Dr. Sefki Kolozali on a project to assist blind individuals through AI and audio technologies using smart glasses. During my BSc studies, I worked on search engines with various AI methods under the supervision of Dr. Habib Rostami. I am currently seeking PhD positions, and my research interests include computer vision, deep generative AI, object detection, trajectory planning, and reasoning in computer vision. Additionally, I am interested in language models (LLMs), optimization techniques for them, and the theoretical foundations of learning.
